# A python function to shift characters of the MNIST dataset

This was an assignment given to students at **AZUBI AFRICA** in the attempt to augment the original data by shifting images left, right, up and down using the step of 1 pixel.

This is a crucial step in ensuring high performance of machine learning algorithms in detecting these images as the dataset is expanded from 70000 rows to 350000 rows.

To check overfitting through data leakage, this exercise was done on only the traning data set.
